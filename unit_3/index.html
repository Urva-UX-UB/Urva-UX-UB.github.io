	<p id="slogan">I design experiences that are easy, intuitive and trustworthy.</p>
	
	<p class="intro">To keep digital experiences user-centric, I apply the time-proven success of Design Thinking methodology - I empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test, review and iterate; then on the best idea grows organically. It is this iterative design process of user-centered solution-based thinking that I apply to drive business growth. It also earned me awards, for apparel design.</p>
